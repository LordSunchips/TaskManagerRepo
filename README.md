# TaskManager
This is a simple task managing app that I made with Swift

The main file is saved in taskmanager.xcodeproj

# Components
This folder contains the SmallAddButton and TaskRow

SmallAddButton - file for storing information about the button to add new tasks to the main list
TaskRow - object that holds a description of the task and a completed status
